# üìò Redis Data Structures
# ===============================

# ===============================
# üìú LISTS
# ===============================
# - Lists are a data structure in the form of a linked list that contains string data.
# - Lists are similar to arrays, where each element in a list has an index number.
# - Common use cases: message queues, task pipelines, and logs.


# ===============================
# üß≠ QUEUE (FIFO)
# ===============================
# - Queue stands for "First In, First Out".
# - The first element added is the first one removed.

## Push value to the left (head) of list
lpush queue value

## Remove and return value from the right (tail)
rpop queue


# ===============================
# üß± STACK (LIFO)
# ===============================
# - Stack stands for "Last In, First Out".
# - The last element added is the first one removed.

## Push value to the stack (left side)
lpush stack value

## Pop value from the stack (left side)
lpop stack value

## Get elements from list within range
lrange queue/stack from until


# ===============================
# üî∑ Sets
# ===============================
# - Sets are unordered collections of unique string elements.
# - Duplicate elements are automatically ignored.
# - Common use cases: tags, unique IDs, removing duplicates, etc.

## Add one or more members to a set
sadd key ...value

##  Get the number of members in a set
scard key

## Get all members in a set
smembers key

## Remove one or more members from a set
srem key ...value

## Get the members of the set resulting from the difference between the first set and all the following sets
sdiff key1 key2

## Get the members of the set resulting from the intersection of all the given sets
sinter key1 key2

## Get the members of the set resulting from the union of all the given sets
sunion key1 key2


# ===============================
# üß© Hash
# ===============================
# - Hashes are data structures composed of field-value pairs (like a JSON object).
# - Useful for representing objects with multiple properties (e.g., user profiles, products).

## Set field(s) in a hash
hset hashname ...key value

## Get value of a field in a hash
hget hashname key

## Get all fields and values in a hash
hgetall hashname

## Increment or decrement a field value in a hash
hincryby hasname key increment-value/decrement-value


# ===============================
# üèÖ Sorted Set
# ===============================
# - Sorted Sets are similar to Sets but each member has a numeric score.
# - Members are ordered by their score (ascending order).
# - If scores are equal, members are sorted lexicographically.
# - Common use cases: leaderboards, rankings, time-based queues.


## Add a member with a specific score to a sorted set
zadd key score member

## Get the number of members in a sorted set
zcard key

## Get all members and their scores in ascending order
zrange key 0 -1 withscores

## Get members in a sorted set by index range (from lowest to highest score)
zrange key start-index end-index

## Get members in a sorted set by score range (from minimum to maximum score)
zrange key minimum-score maximum-score byscore

## Remove one or more members from a sorted set
zrem key ...member

## Remove members from a sorted set within a specific score range
zremrangebyscore member minimum-score maximum-score


# ===============================
# üìç Geospatial
# ===============================
# - Geospatial structures are used to store geographic locations as coordinates.
# - Ideal for applications that need distance or radius queries (e.g., finding nearby stores, users, etc.)

## Add location coordinates to a geospatial key
geoadd key longitude latitude member

## Get position (longitude and latitude) of a member
geopos key member

## Get the distance between two members
geodist key member1 member2 distance-unit

## Search for members within a given radius
geosearch key fromlonlat longitude latitude BYRADIUS distance distance-unit
